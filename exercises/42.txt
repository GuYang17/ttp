Oh, Forty-Two, so plain yet grand,
A number few can understand.
From cosmic depths, the answer came,
Yet none recall the question’s name.

The mice may ask, the dolphins sigh,
The Vogons chant, the stars reply.
But deep in code or printed line,
You shine with meaning—pure, divine.

A joke? A truth? We’ll never know,
Yet still your legend seems to grow.
So here’s to you, dear cryptic friend,
The answer—waiting for the end.
